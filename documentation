Chrome extemsion is software program(html, css, JavaScript) for adding additonal feature to chrome through some of the chrome exposed JavaScript APIs.
An exenstion is nothing but a web page hoisted within chrome and can access additional APIs.

page actions- chrome extension specific to particular webpages. Usually seen in the google chrome address bar.
broweser actions - not specific to pages and is relevent no matter where your in the browser. UI added to right of the address bar.

Files to be included 
1. The most important file to include is the manifest.json file 
    A chrome extesion is defined by manifest.json file. It included the version , how to interept the extension, what files to load and how to interact with users.
    basic manifest script
    {
        "manifest_version": 2,
        "name": "My first extension",
        "version" : 0.1        
    }

    manifest_version tells Chrome what version of the manifest markup you’re working with. For modern extensions, you’ll need to set this to 2.
    browser action loads the icon into the toolbar. It also allows the extension to respond to user input by displaying a tooltip, popup or badge.
    permissions limits the extension’s functional region. activeTab is the most common, allowing the extension to access the front-most tab. 

2. To load your extension to chrome
    1. go to chrome://extensions/ in browser
    2. enable developer mode
    3. load upacked and choose the folder , go the new tab you  and reload , you ll be see the extension on the toolbar
        When you change or add code in your extension, just come back to this page and reload the page. Chrome will reload your extension.
3. Content Scripts --> JavaScript file that run in context of webpages.
    // content.js
    alert("Hello from your Chrome extension!")
    to inject the script we need to tell the manifest to load the content.js file 
    include the below code snippet
    "content_scripts": [
  {
    "matches": [
      "<all_urls>"
    ],
    "js": ["content.js"]
  }
]
and reload the extension
